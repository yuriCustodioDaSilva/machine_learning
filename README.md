# machine_learning
The purpose of this repository is to store some machine learning models as I learn and explore the field.

I will start exploring personalized recommendations more deeply. Although I'm not sure how I'll acquire the necessary dataset, I'll do my best. One idea I have is to create a bot to randomly select workouts every day or ask ChatGPT to generate some scenarios. I need to study accessible options to move forward.
